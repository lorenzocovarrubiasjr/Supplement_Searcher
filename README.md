# SupplementSearcher

Welcome to SupplementSearcher. The one stop shop for the Global Healing Center in Houston, TX. You can view all products, their availability, price, rating and description. You can also launch to make a purchase thru this CLI project. I will apply at this company once I complete my Flatiron schooling! It's not too far from where I live and last I checked they pay well for developers. :). Get your health on!
